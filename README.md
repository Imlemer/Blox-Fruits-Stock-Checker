Hello dear user! This is a program that tells you if a fruit is in stock. It also tells you all the fruits that are on stock.

You can use it when you don't want to travel far from your current location just to see your desired fruit being out of stock...

Note that this program grabs the stock from the fandom of Blox Fruits, and the results may be inaccurate. Usually it takes ~5 minutes for the stock in the fandom page to update to the current Blox Fruits stock
